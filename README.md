# Chadnet System Alpha

These are tools that are used by Chadnet for the wiki. (wiki.chadnet.org)

## Specific tools

`wiki.sh` is used to run the `wiki/` folder. This is used for building the
site.

`upload.sh` uploads the wiki to the site. (Will get improvements soon.)

More information, code, and documentation will be added here soon.
